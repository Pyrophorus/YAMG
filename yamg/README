Yet Another Map generator
-------------------------

This is a regular 'mod'. Drop it in your local folder and activate it in OAD.
It contains a library split in two files:
	- fractal.js: contains all what is needed for fractal map generation, which can create full maps or work only on maps areas (Fractal Painter).
	- placers.js: contains various utilities to create roads, define regions and borders.
Both parts of the library are independant and can be used separately.

A random map script "Egyptian Oasis" is provided as well.

Upgrade note.
-------------
This version is for alpha-22, but can be easily upgraded to alpha-23.
	- of course, modifying the dependency in the 'mod.json' file.
	- The library itself don't call anything in rmgen, and work only with a proprietary tiles map.
A problem may arise when using the placers from a script written for alpha-23 (Not the Egyptian Oasis which don't call place() method). For now, the place() method of placers returns a PointXZ array, but through a convenience function located at the beginning of the 'placers.js' file:

/**
 * This function extracts a points array from a zone (which is a cells array)
 * Mainly to help rmgen compatibility. Change this to Vector2D if desired, it's the only reference to PointXZ in the library 
 */
function zoneToPoints(zone)
{
	let points = [];
	for(let c of zone) {
		points.push(new PointXZ(c.x,c.y)); // change this to points.push(new Vector2D(c.x,c.y)); if Vector2D is preferred.
	}
	return points;
}

/**
 * This function extracts a zone (which is a cells array) from a point array
 * Mainly to help rmgen compatibility.
 */
function pointsToZone(points)
{
	let zone = [];
	for(let p of points) {
		zone.push(g_TOMap.gCells(p.x,p.z)); // change this to zone.push(g_TOMap.gCells(p.x,p.y)); if Vector2D is preferred.
	}
	return points;
}

The library and the Egyptian Oasis don't use any point object, and should upgrade nicely.

Have fun !
