Yet Another Map generator
-------------------------

This is a regular 'mod'. Drop it in your local folder and activate it in OAD.
It contains a library split in two files:
	- fractal.js: contains all what is needed for fractal map generation, which can create full maps or work only on maps areas (Fractal Painter).
	- placers.js: contains various utilities to create roads, define regions and borders.
Both parts of the library are independant and can be used separately.

A random map script "An Egyptian Oasis" is provided as well.

Upgrade note.
-------------
This version is for alpha-23 only.
The various fractal painters conform to painter interface in rmgen, so can be used in rmgen calls.

The placer and utilities are rmgen compatible too but use a Cell object and a g_TOMap special cell map rmgen knows nothing of. So, you must create the g_TOMap object before using these utilities. Anyway, cells objects inherit from Vector2D which means you can use them in rmgen calls which requires a 'position' parameter or build Cell arrays.

IMPORTANT WARNING
-----------------
Even if you can use cells objects instead of Vector2D when using rmgen functions, you MUST NOT pass a cell array to the Area constructor. The reason is this constructor makes read-only the cell objects it deals with. The call will succeed, but later, every yamg attempt to write those frozen objects will raise a fatal error.
A solution maybe found in the future, but for now, if you need to create an Area from a cell array (for instance the border provided by the YPatchPlacer), you must pass a Vector2D array duplicating this cell array to prevent unwanted modifications. The 'zoneToPoints()' function does this for you.
Instead of: new Area(some_Cell_Array); use new Area(zoneToPoints(some_Cell_Array));

Note the place() method of YPatchPlacer does this, so it's safe to use it in a createArray call (which obviously invokes Area constructor).


Have fun !
