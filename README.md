Yet another maps generator for O-A-D
----------------------------------------

This is a regular 'mod' for O-A-D. Drop it in your local folder and activate it in tool menu of O-A-D.
It contains a library split in two files:
	- fractal.js: contains all what is needed for fractal map generation, which can create full maps or work only on maps areas (Fractal Painter).
	- placers.js: contains various utilities to create roads, define regions and borders.
Both parts of the library are independant and can be used separately.

A random map script "An Egyptian Oasis" is provided as well.

Upgrade note.
-------------
This version is for alpha-23 only.

WARNING
-------
There is a compatibility problem with a part of rmgen library. See the README for details.

Have fun !
